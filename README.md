## Hi 👋🦒🌮🏌️‍♂️🎾🎺☕️📚😁

My name is Adam Sulemanji, and I'm a current masters of computer science student at [Texas A&M University] with a desire to solve problems and hopefully learn something and build some cool stuff. I'm currently working [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=14770868011)  as a software engineer intern hoping to return full time, where I work on Crosslistings. 

### What I'm working on 👨‍💻
- 📚📚 [Course Monitoring](): a website that allows students to create and monitor courses for registration. 
- 🤖🤖 [Alexa Stock ]An Alexa based application to help my monitor my stocks. 
- 🎉🎉 [BirthdayParty](): A tool to help me remember important dates and birthdays.
